# jigsawAssembler
A superset for the assembly programing language.

## This is NOT ready at all, I'm on the idea phase so it effevtivelly doesn't exists.

Nevertherless, you can help me develop it and you CAN look at the documentation.

Here is the idea: What if we could make assembly more verbosable?

Is there a way to make it more human readable and still allow the user to write the same old asm?

I do think it has - and this is the jigsawAssembler language.

Think of it as a low-level typescript.
