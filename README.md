# jigsawAssembler
A superset for the assembly programing language.

Here is the idea: What if we could make assembly more verbosable?

Is there a way to make it more human readable and still allow the user to write the same old asm?

I do think it has - and this is the jigsawAssembler language.

Think of it as a low-level typescript.
